This repository is an overview of all my other repositores, clubs, and contributions

----PROJECTS----

	AWS Lambda
This project is one I did to familiarize myself with the AWS Lambda features. The program responds to an S3 storage file creation, sending an email to the specified individuals containing the size and name of the file. Credit to @thigley986 for the boto3 implementation of sending an email.

	Musical Words
This is a project that myself a friend from Georgia Tech occasionally work on. Its eventual operation will be to take input from the user in the form of sentence, and then output a real-time generated song based on the syllable count of the words.

	The Game
The Game is a 2-D platformer that I built. Myself and a couple friend intended to build a fully functioning game that we could use to run competitions at our school and generate money. While we ended up never fully finishing it, I've since been looking into game design more, as it was some of the best fun I've had coding.

----CLUBS----

	CSIP
CSIP stands for Computer Science Interview Prep, and is a club that meets weekly where members work to solve coding problems, ranging from simple for-loop solutions to those requiring dynamic programming and more complex data structures.

----CONTRIBUTIONS----

	Rex Machina
Everything Rex Machina is part of an FRC Robotics team I was the lead programmer, founder, and for a while leader of. I did everything from building the programs that would run the robot to programming and putting together a Raspberry Pi to run vision recognition. Almost 100% of that code is in one of the many repositories I contributed to with Rex Machina in the title.
